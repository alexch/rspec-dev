RSpec is the original Behaviour Driven Development framework for Ruby.

h2. Get Started

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
<p>
  Start with a very simple example that expresses
  some basic desired behaviour.
</p>

<% coderay do -%>
# bowling_spec.rb
require 'bowling'

describe Bowling do
  before(:each) do
    @bowling = Bowling.new
  end

  it "should score 0 for gutter game" do
    20.times { @bowling.hit(0) }
    @bowling.score.should == 0
  end
end
<% end -%>

<p>
  Run the example and watch it fail.
</p>
<pre style="color:red;">$ spec bowling_spec.rb 
./bowling_spec.rb:4:
  uninitialized constant Bowling
</pre>
    </td>
    <td width="50%">
<p>
  Now write
  just enough code to make it pass.
</p>

<% coderay do -%>
# bowling.rb
class Bowling
  def hit(pins)
  end

  def score
    0
  end
end
<% end -%>
<p>
Run the example and bask in the joy that is green.
</p>

<pre style="color:green;">$ spec bowling_spec.rb --format specdoc

Bowling
- should score 0 for gutter game

h2. Take very small steps

Don't rush ahead with more code. Instead, add another example and let it guide you to what you have to do next. And don't forget to take time to refactor your code before it gets messy. You should keep your code clean at every step of the way.

h2. Take the first step now!

<pre>
$ gem install rspec
</pre>
