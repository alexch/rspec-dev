h2. Spec::Expectations and Spec::Matchers

When RSpec executes specifications, it defines <code>#should</code> and <code>#should_not</code> on
every object in the system. These methods are your entry to the magic of RSpec.

See "Spec::Expectations":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/rspec/1.1.12/classes/Spec/Expectations.html and "Spec::Matchers":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/rspec/1.1.12/classes/Spec/Matchers.html for more information.
