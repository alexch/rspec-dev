Helper Examples live in $RAILS_ROOT/spec/helpers/.

Writing specs for your helpers is a snap. Just tell the Example Group the name of the
helper ...

<% coderay do -%>
describe RegistrationHelper do
  ...
end
<% end -%>

... and the Example Group will expose an object that includes the helper.

h2. Conveniences

h3. assigns

Use assigns[:key] to set instance variables to be used in the view that
includes the helper. See example below.
