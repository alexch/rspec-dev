Here is an example of a spec for a Stack. We start with a group of shared examples.
These won't get run directly, but can be included by, and run in the context of
other example groups.

<% coderay do -%><%= IO.read "../example_rails_app/vendor/plugins/rspec/examples/passing/shared_stack_examples.rb" %><% end -%>

And here is the group that runs them.

<% coderay do -%><%= IO.read "../example_rails_app/vendor/plugins/rspec/examples/passing/stack_spec_with_nested_example_groups.rb" %><% end -%>

And here is what you see when you run these examples in TextMate:
